# About Me

Hereâ€™s the fun part.

- Loves painting Warhammer 40k miniatures (currently: Dark Angels)
- Proud co-architect of WoW auction house macros
- Has strong feelings about institutional design, tax incentives, and Herbert Simon
- Once explained the logic of interlocal agreements while high on Nutella

This site hosts both the polished professional side and the eccentricities underneath. Thanks for visiting.
