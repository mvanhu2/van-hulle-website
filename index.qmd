# Michael P. Van Hulle

**Urban governance scholar | Former litigator | Institutional enthusiast**

Welcome to my academic website. I'm a PhD candidate in Public Administration at the University of Illinois Chicago. My research explores how contracts, networks, and institutions shape authority and collective action in citiesâ€”especially when it comes to service delivery and public finance. Before entering academia, I litigated corporate governance disputes and asylum claims in New York.
