PROFILE
Scholar of urban governance, institutional analysis, and intergovernmental collaboration, with a background in law, economics, and public administration. My research investigates how contracts, rules, and network structure authority and collective actionâ€”especially within cities. I bring doctrinal fluency and field-tested methods to bear on practical challenges in public finance, urban service delivery, and organizational design. Former litigator; current architect of reproducible, policy-relevant tools.
